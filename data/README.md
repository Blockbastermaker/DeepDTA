
## Data Explanation

For more detailed information, please refer to the [DeepDTA article](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i821/5093245).

### Similarity files

For each dataset, there are two similarity files, drug-drug and target-target similarities.
*  Drug-drug similarities obtained via Pubchem structure clustering.
*  Target-target similarities are obtained via S-W similarity.

These files were used to re-produce the results of two other methods [(Pahikkala et al., 2017)](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/16/2/325/246479) and [(He et al., 2017)](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0209-z), and also for some experiments in DeepDTA model, please refer to [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i821/5093245). 
*  The original Davis data and more explanation can be found [here](http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~aatapa/data/DrugTarget/).
